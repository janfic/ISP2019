A Compiler for a Domain-specific Language for Entity Component Modeling
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to further my understanding of DSLs and the Groovy language while continuing development of a game of mine, USER IDE.

The game contains support, and main gameplay, of the creation of components, entities, systems, and assets in a libGDX based Entity-Component System named Ashley. The DSL aim is to simplify this process for the typical gamer. This means the developement of the DSL, named (for now) USER, will have this goal in mind.

Proposed USER Flow Model
-------------------------------------------------

USER SCRIPT >>>[Translator]>>> Java/Groovy file

The Java/Groovy File created can be used by the game itself. This part of the projectt does not in the current scope of this project. This ISP will focus on the designing of USER and the translator for it.

The translator will be written in Groovy, a dynamic multi-faceted language, that alters the J(ava)VM to the G(roovy)VM to allow amazing capabilities of a Java-like language. This language is frequently used to create languages, like Gradle.

Documentation
-----------------------------------

Documentation of USER will be written in the WIKI, for easy access and organization.
